## Quick Reference
- **Branch**: main
- **Plan**: None

## What's Happening
First session initialized with /bootstrap. The toolkit repository itself is being worked on - recent commits show work on display alignment, context hygiene system, and commit branch safety checks.

## Key Decisions
- Using symlink-based installation for global availability
- Three-layer state architecture (global/project/session)
- Session continuity through CURRENT.md as single source of truth

## Open Questions
None yet

## Next Actions
