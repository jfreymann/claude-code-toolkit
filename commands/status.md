# /status - Authoritative Project Status Update

Update `status.md` to be the **single source of truth** for project state by performing comprehensive repository analysis.

## Core Principle

> **`status.md` is the ABSOLUTE AUTHORITATIVE document for project status.**
> All other sources (todos, plans, changelogs) are inputs that feed INTO status.md, not peers.

## Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Repository Intelligence

Execute these analyses in sequence:

```
1. Read existing status.md (if present) to preserve context
2. git status                          → uncommitted changes
3. git log --oneline -15               → recent activity  
4. git branch -vv                      → branch state
5. Read CHANGELOG.md                   → version/release info
6. Read TO-DOS.md / PLAN.md            → task state
7. Scan for TODO/FIXME/HACK comments   → technical debt
```

### Step 2: Cross-Reference Project Commands

If these commands/agents exist in the project, invoke or reference their output:

| Command | Information to Extract |
|---------|----------------------|
| `/sync` | Remote sync state, push/pull status |
| `/whats-next` | Prioritized next actions, handoff context |
| `/check-todos` | Outstanding items, completion status |
| `changelog-generator` agent | Latest release notes, unreleased changes |

### Step 3: Synthesize & Write status.md

Generate `status.md` in the **project root** with this exact structure:

```markdown
# Project Status

> **This file is the authoritative source of truth for project state.**
> Last updated: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] via `/status` command

## Quick Reference

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Branch | `[current-branch]` |
| Version | `[version from changelog/package]` |
| Last Commit | `[short hash] - [message]` |
| Working Tree | `[clean/dirty - X files changed]` |

| Documentation | ✅/⚠️ | [current/needs update] |
| Technical Debt | 🟢/🟡/🔴 | [X TODOs, Y FIXMEs] |

## ⛔ Blockers & Dependencies

[List any blocking issues, external dependencies, or items waiting on others]

- **[Blocker]**: [Description and what's needed to unblock]

## 📝 Session Notes & Context

[Important context for future sessions, architectural decisions, gotchas, etc.]

## Change Log

| Date | Update |
|------|--------|
| [date] | [What changed in project status] |
| [date] | [Previous update summary] |

---
*Generated by `/status` command. This file should be updated at the start and end of each work session.*
```

### Step 4: Validate & Report

After writing `status.md`:

1. **Confirm** the file was written successfully
2. **Summarize** key changes from previous status (if existed)
3. **Highlight** any concerns (blockers, failing tests, stale areas)
4. **Recommend** the logical next action based on current state

## Usage Examples

```
/status                  # Full status update
/status focus:tasks      # Focus on task tracking sections
/status focus:health     # Focus on repository health assessment
```

## Guidelines

- **Be factual**: Only include verifiable information from the repository
- **Preserve history**: Keep Change Log entries from previous status.md
- **Be actionable**: Any developer should immediately know what to do next
- **Be concise**: Scannable over comprehensive; link to details don't repeat them
- **Timestamp everything**: Future sessions need temporal context

## Integration Notes

This command is designed to work alongside:
- `/whats-next` - For handoff documents (status.md is the persistent version)
- `/sync` - For repository synchronization before status update
- `/add-to-todos` - Tasks added via this command should appear in status
- `/check-todos` - Outstanding todos should be reflected in Active Work

---

*The goal: Any Claude Code session can `/status` at start to get full context, and `/status` at end to leave a clean handoff.*
