## Git Safety Rules

**CRITICAL - NEVER VIOLATE THESE:**

### Automatic Git Operations Are FORBIDDEN

**NEVER commit or push code automatically, proactively, or without explicit user command.**

- ❌ NEVER run `git commit` unless user explicitly invokes `/commit` or similar command
- ❌ NEVER run `git push` unless user explicitly invokes git-workflow-manager or says "push code"
- ❌ NEVER assume "feature is complete" means "auto-commit and push"
- ❌ NEVER commit as a "helpful" next step after implementation
- ❌ NEVER push to main/master under ANY circumstances (even if user asks)

### Required User Intent

Git operations require **explicit user intent**:

✅ **Allowed**:
- User says: `/commit`, `/pre-commit`, "push code", "create PR", "git-workflow-manager"
- User explicitly asks: "commit this", "push this", "create a commit"

❌ **FORBIDDEN**:
- Automatic commits after writing code
- Proactive "I'll commit this for you"
- Assuming completion means committing
- Any git operation without explicit user request

### If Uncertain

**When in doubt about git operations: ASK, don't assume.**

Example:
```
User: "The feature is complete"
❌ Wrong: *automatically commits and pushes*
✅ Right: "Feature looks complete. Ready to commit? (Use /pre-commit or /commit)"
```
